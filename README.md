# Lucky Number

A simple React project using Ethers (Sepolia testnet) for predicting a random number using a smart contract.

## How to Play

1. **Connect to a wallet** (e.g., MetaMask, etc.).
2. **Deposit an amount of ether** to start.
3. **Pick a number** from 1 to 14 and choose the amount to bet.
4. **Hit the play button** and wait for the result. If the lucky number matches your chosen number, you will receive double your stake.
