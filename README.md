# Lucky Number

A simple React project uses Ethers (Sepolia testnet) as currency to predict a random number using a smart contract.

## How to Play

1. **Connect to a wallet** (e.g., MetaMask, etc.).
2. **Deposit an amount of ether** to start.
3. **Pick a number** from 1 to 14 and choose the amount to bet.
4. **Hit the play button** and wait for the result. You will receive double your stake if the lucky number matches your chosen number.
